## Overview

This project focuses on classifying images of various types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, and bicycles. Using Teachable Machine, users can easily train models to identify and categorize these vehicles from images.

## Features

- Train custom image classification models using Teachable Machine.
- Classify images of vehicles into predefined categories.
- Export and integrate trained models into applications or scripts.
- Beginner-friendly workflow with no prior machine learning experience required.

## Dataset

The dataset includes images of the following vehicle categories:

- Cars
- Trucks
- Motorcycles
- Buses
- Bicycles

Images are organized into labeled folders, and users can add or modify categories based on their specific needs.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd vehicle-classification
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (if running additional scripts locally):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Using Teachable Machine

### Step 1: Prepare the Dataset

1. Collect and organize images into folders, with one folder per category (e.g., `Car`, `Truck`).
2. Ensure all images are resized appropriately and are of good quality.

### Step 2: Train the Model

1. Visit [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
2. Select the **Image Project** option and start a new project.
3. Upload your images by dragging and dropping them into the respective categories (e.g., Car, Truck, etc.).
4. Train your model by clicking the "Train Model" button.

### Step 3: Export the Model

1. Once training is complete, export the model.
2. Choose the appropriate export format (e.g., TensorFlow, TensorFlow\.js) for your deployment.
3. Download the model files to your local machine.

## Model Deployment

### Using TensorFlow\.js

To deploy the model in a web application:

1. Copy the exported model files to your project folder.
2. Use the `model.json` file in your JavaScript code to load the model.
3. Follow the Teachable Machine’s [deployment guide](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/machine-learning/deploy/) for detailed instructions.

### Using Python

To use the model in Python scripts:

1. Export the model in TensorFlow format.
2. Load the model using TensorFlow or Keras:
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
   model = load_model('path_to_your_model')
   ```
3. Use the model for predictions on new images.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using a separate validation dataset to measure performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall can be calculated using tools like Python’s scikit-learn library.

## Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy in identifying vehicles from the test dataset. Performance metrics and visualizations of the results are included in the `results` folder.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand the dataset to include more vehicle types.
- Improve model performance using advanced augmentation techniques.
- Create a user-friendly web or mobile application for real-time classification.
